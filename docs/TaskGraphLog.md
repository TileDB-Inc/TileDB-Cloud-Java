## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**uuid** | **String** | The server-generated UUID of the task graph. |  [optional] [readonly]
**namespace** | **String** | The namespace that owns this task graph log. When creating a task graph log, this is used as the namespace to create the log in; thereafter it is read-only.  |  [optional]
**createdBy** | **String** | The name of the user who created this task graph log. |  [optional] [readonly]
**name** | **String** | A name for this task graph log, displayed in the UI. Does not need to be unique.  |  [optional]
**createdAt** | **OffsetDateTime** | The date/time when this task graph log was originally created. This is distinct from the execution start_time.  |  [optional] [readonly]
**startTime** | **OffsetDateTime** | The start time of the task graph, recorded when the server starts executing the first node.  |  [optional] [readonly]
**endTime** | **OffsetDateTime** | The end time of the task graph, recorded when the client reports completion.  |  [optional] [readonly]
**status** | **TaskGraphLogStatus** |  |  [optional]
**totalCost** | **BigDecimal** | If present, the total cost of executing all nodes in this task graph.  |  [optional]
**accessCost** | **BigDecimal** | If present, the total cost of access from execution of the nodes in this task graph.  |  [optional]
**egressCost** | **BigDecimal** | If present, the total cost of access from execution of the nodes in this task graph.  |  [optional]
**executionTime** | **String** | The total execution time of all the nodes in this graph, in ISO 8601 format with hours, minutes, and seconds.  |  [optional]
**statusCount** | **Map&lt;String, BigDecimal&gt;** | A mapping from &#x60;ArrayTaskStatus&#x60; string value to the number of nodes in this graph that are in that status.  |  [optional]
**nodes** | [**List&lt;TaskGraphNodeMetadata&gt;**](TaskGraphNodeMetadata.md) | The structure of the graph. This is provided by the client when first setting up the task graph. Thereafter, it is read-only. This must be topographically sorted; that is, each node must appear after all nodes that it depends upon.  |  [optional]
